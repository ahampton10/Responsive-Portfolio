      <p>Hello, and welcome to my first website! My name is Alex, and I am a Tlinget Alaska Native, born and raised just north of Anchorage, AK. I moved to Colorado about 6 years ago and have spent the last 5 years living in beautiful Crested Butte, CO. I recently moved to the Front Range with my fiancee to be closer to family. </p>
      <p>Having been raised in Alaska, a passion for the outdoors is always something that has come naturally to me. I love skiing, backpacking, hiking, fishing, and camping to name a few. I also love to travel the world, am a lover of good food, and am an avid chef. The past few years I have been fortunte enough to travel to France, Spain, New Zealand, Belgium, Italy, Puerto Rico, as well as several destinations within the United States. I am excited to see where coding takes me next!</p>
